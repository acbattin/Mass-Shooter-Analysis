# Mass-Shooter-Analysis
Big Data Analysis project using The Violence Project database, a publicly available database containing information relating to mass shootings in the United States of America and the shooter's themselves. Using R and Python I aim to answer several questions of interest.

# Dataset Information
The Violence Project Database is the largest, most comprehensive source of information on the psychosocial histories of mass public shooters in the United States. It currently has over 180 independent variables and at the time of download, the reported size of the dataset is 989KB of data. Responsibility for the contents of the database lies solely with the Principal Investigators, professors Jillian Peterson (Hamline University) and James Densley (Metro State University). This project followed a research methodology that has proven effective in terrorism studies, which also are rare events that can result in mass casualties. The database was constructed using public records and open-source data.

# Questions of Interest
Three questions of interest are specified in the above dataset selection and description,
and they are numbered accordingly and are as follows:

Question 1. What (if any) Signs of Being in A Crisis were observed?

Question 2. What can be said about the mental health background of mass shooters in the United States?

Question 3. What (if any) variables are most closely correlated with Suicidality?

# What Signs of Being in a Crisis were Observed?
Calculate summary statistics for the crisis variables, present summary statistics for the following variables: Signs of Being in Crisis – table of counts/proportions for this discrete, binary variable’s values 0 and 1 where 0 indicates No Evidence and 1 indicates Yes, there was evidence of the perpetrator’s circumstances overwhelming their coping mechanisms causing a marked change in behavior from baseline. We confirm that there is no missing data and create bar chart for counts by reported level because this is a categorical, binary variable to visualize the proportion of Perpetrators that demonstrated a marked change in behavior from baseline.
